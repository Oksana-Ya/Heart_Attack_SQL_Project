# 💓 Heart Attack Analysis – SQL Portfolio Project

This SQL-based data analytics project explores patient heart health data to uncover trends and risk factors associated with heart attacks. The project uses pure SQL to analyze key metrics such as blood pressure, age, blood sugar, troponin, CK-MB, and gender.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To identify risk patterns in heart health and find correlations between medical indicators and heart attack outcomes using SQL.

## 📂 Files

- 📄 [Download SQL Queries](Heart_attack_analysis.sql)
- 📄 [Download Sample Dataset (CSV)](Medicaldataset.csv)

---

## 🔍 Key Techniques Used

- Aggregate functions (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `ROUND`)
- Conditional logic (`CASE`)
- CTEs for risk classification
- Window functions for percentages

---

## 📌 Summary Insights

- Higher levels of CK-MB and Troponin are found in patients with positive results.
- Age group 50–69 is most affected by heart attacks.
- Blood pressure stages and high blood sugar correlate with increased heart attack risk.
- Gender group 1 showed a higher percentage of positive cases.
